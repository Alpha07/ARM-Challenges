# ARM Challenges
ARM Challenges is a set of levels to teach beginner security researchers the basics of ARM exploitation. It consists of binaries meant to be reversed engineered. You can find these binaries precompiled in some different ARM architectures: `armv7` (32-bit iOS), `arm64` (64-bit iOS) and `armv7l`  (32-bit Raspberry Pi).

### Available levels
`stack0`: the aim of this first level is to change a variable's value which is not user controlled. | Write-up can be found [here](https://h0strix.github.io/set-up-environment/).
